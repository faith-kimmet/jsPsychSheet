            <p class="consent-header">Purpose of the research study:</p>
            <p class="consent-text-block">The primary purpose of this study is to examine how effectively you can perceive perceptual items, to 
                evaluate how you rate confidence in what you have seen, and to assess personality traits.
            </p>
            <p class="consent-header">What you will be asked to do in the study: </p>
            <p class="consent-text-block">If you agree to be in the study, we will ask you to do the following things: (1) sit in front of a computer 
                monitor to detect briefly-presented visual items and rate confidence in what you have seen; (2) Fill out 
                responses on a few personality trait inventories.  All responses in this experiment will be completely 
                anonymous.  
            </p>
            <p class="consent-header">Time required:</p>
            <p class="consent-text-block">One session, which can last up to 30 Minutes</p>
            <p class="consent-header">Risks and benefits:</p>
            <p class="consent-text-block">There are no known risks associated with your participation in this study. The risk to participants
                would not exceed anything that a participant may experience in everyday life. Very similar
                studies have been conducted by the principal investigator, Dr. Brian Odegaard and there have never been 
                any reported instances of discomfort. There are no direct benefits of participation to you, but you will be 
                contributing to scientific knowledge about how visual information is encoded and remembered.
            </p>
            <p class="consent-header">Confidentiality:</p>
            <p class="consent-text-block">Your identity will be kept confidential to the extent provided by law. Your information will be assigned a 
                code number, and your name will not be attached to your data in any way, thus ensuring that your 
                responses will be completely anonymous.  Your name will not be used in any report.

                Only the researchers will have access to the information we collect online. There is a minimal risk that 
                security of any online data may be breached, but since no identifying information will be collected, it is unlikely that a security 
                breach of the online data will result in any adverse consequence for you.
            </p>
            <p class="consent-header">Compensation Policy:</p>
            <p class="consent-text-block">Participants who will be participating in this study through SONA as part of the participation pool will 
                receive 1 course credit for the 30 minute study.</b>
